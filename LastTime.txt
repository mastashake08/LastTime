(Hook) x 2
It's the last time you ain't gon treat me right
It's the last time you gon see me, night
It's the last time you gon be in my life
It's the last time

(Mastashake verse 1)
It's the last time I'mma deal with this shit
It's the last time imma be in It's bitch
Pack my shit shit and I hit the door
I can't deal with the toxic no more

Your words they hurt more than your fists
I wanna hurt you back but I gotta resist
I try to tell you how I feel but I get dismissed
So you get off with a slap of the wrist

Hook x 2
